Terra.jl is a new and upcoming land model that aims to support hybrid physics- and data-driven land modeling across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We envision Terra to be part of a new generation of land models that combines modularity, interactivity, GPU-compability and differentiability for seamless integration of process-based and data-driven model components in both global and regional scale simulations of the land surface.

Terra is being developed alongside SpeedyWeather.jl and Oceananigans.jl as the land component of the proposed DELTA-ESM project which aims to build a new class of Earth System Model in the Julia programming language that enables hybrid geophysical modeling across multiple scales and application domains.

> This is an early prototype of our model and is not production-ready. Expect things to change rapidly and break often. If you share our vision for a new paradigm of Earth system modeling and would like to get involved in the project, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out by creating an issue on GitHub issues or sending us an email. We are always happy to welcome new collaborators.
