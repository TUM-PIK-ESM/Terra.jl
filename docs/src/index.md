# Terrarium.jl

Terrarium.jl is a new and upcoming land model that aims to support hybrid physics- and data-driven land modeling across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We envision Terrarium to be part of a new generation of Earth system component models that combine modularity, interactivity, GPU-compability and auto-differentiability (AD) for seamless integration of process-based and data-driven model components in both global and regional scale simulations.

Terrarium is being developed alongside [SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl) and [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl) as the land component of a new, user-friendly, and fully GPU/AD-compatible Earth System Model in the Julia programming language.

!!! warning "ðŸš§ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§ðŸš§"
    This is an early prototype of our model and is not production-ready. Expect things to change rapidly and break often. If you share our vision for a new paradigm of Earth system modeling and would like to get involved in the project, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out by creating an issue on GitHub issues or sending us an email. We are always happy to welcome new collaborators!
